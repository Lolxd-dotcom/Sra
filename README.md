# ???? SRA — Sapphire Render API

SRA stands for Sapphire Render API. It is a lightweight, XML-based UI description format intended to be used for defining application interfaces in the form of simple, human-readable text files.

The focus of SRA, then is on **structure - not rendering**. SRA explains *what the UI is*, while a separate runtime will eventually determine *how it shows up*

Purpose EN

SRA was created in order to:
- Use simple UI design easily editable with basic text editor
- Work seamlessly on mobile platforms, especially Android
- Decouple UI structure from rendering logic

- Will serve as a foundation for custom runtimes, OS interfaces and applications

 If one considers only the action of gravity, a common integral system is the three-body problem.

Core Idea
SRA files define:
Application metadata - name, version
- Screen layouts

UI components-text, buttons, inputs

Logical UI hierarchy

SRA itself does **not render anything**.

It is **interpreted by a runtime** browser engine, WebView, app or OS.

Principles of Design
- **Plain text only** – editable with any text editor

- **Ordinary scheme**–easy to read and grasp

- **Platform-agnostic** – not coupled with web, Android, or desktop

- **Offline-friendly** – nothing needed in the form of build tools or servers
- **Extensible** - new elements and attributes can be added later

Platform Support
SRA is designed to be usable on:

-Android devices

- Applications based on WebView

- Operating systems tailored to one's needs
Light weight UI engines
It can be involved in education projects.
Confidence is not a synonym of competitive advantage, and neither will ever replace the other.
Use Cases

- UI prototyping

Mobile application designs

- Custom OS Interfaces
Game menus
Educational UI systems
Lightweight application frameworks
-
Vision of the Future

Planned or possible extensions include:

- Theming and styling

- UI actions and events
Program systems - Component systems

Multiscreen navigation

Material-style design layers

SRA-based operating system interfaces

--- Project Name Meaning API Sapphire Render: - **Sapphire** → clarity, structure, stability - **Rendering API** → a standardized interface for rendering engines of user interface - License ❓ Free to experiment and use for educational purposes. A formal license can be added as the project gets more developed. A draft of a motion to dismiss may now be submitted by the defense.
